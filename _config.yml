why_choose_us: >
  MAH Architects Inc. is dedicated to client-first sustainable architecture. We believe great architecture is a collaborative process, reflecting the input and ideas of everyone involved rather than solely the architect's vision.
    Our team comprises licensed, registered, and experienced architects, visionary designers, and supporting engineering professionals. This integrated team efficiently leverages their expertise to create architectural masterpieces.
    Our working tools included modern technology such as **Building Information Modeling software (BIM)** and contract administration software to ensure seamless construction and compliance with jurisdictional construction standards. 
    Our practice rules and regulations are followed as standardized by the **Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC)**, **Ontario Association of Architects (OAA)**, and other local and International regulatory bodies.
