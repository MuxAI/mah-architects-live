    Our working tools included modern technology such as Building Information Modeling software (BIM) and contract administration software to ensure seamless construction and compliance with jurisdictional construction standards. 
    Our practice rules and regulations are followed as standardized by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), Ontario Association of Architects (OAA), and other local and International regulatory bodies."
